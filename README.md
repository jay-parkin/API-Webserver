# API Webserver: Income & Expense Tracker

## R1: Problem Statement

Managing personal and shared finances can be challenging, especially for couples who need to keep track of joint income and expenses. <br>
Many existing financial management tools offer comprehensive budget planning features, but they often fall short in providing a simple and efficient way to track financial transactions among multiple users. <br>
This can lead to difficulties in maintaining shared finances, resulting in misunderstandings or conflicts over financial matters.

Personally, I've tried budgeting apps, but nothing suited what I needed, leaving my wife and me to compare expenses at the end of the week. This left holes in our budget. <br>
I've spent many hours on the internet in search of an expense tracker that can be shared between couples so that no expense is left untracked. <br><br>
I haven't yet found one that works for me... next best solution? create my own.
